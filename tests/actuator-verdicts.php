/**
 * actuator-verdicts — the verdicts walk the HANDED required-set (rule 10, step 4), report a
 * verdict and never a value, and read settings rather than an environment MODx cannot see.
 *
 * WHAT MOVED. This suite used to prove the list was generated from service.json's required_in.
 * That enumeration left the manifest (step 4); generation now happens in infra's
 * config/scripts/required-set.py (drilled there, `--drill`), and what this file proves is the
 * WALKER: every shape the handed artifact takes produces the right rows, and nothing but
 * key/ok/detail ever leaves. Fixtures below are copied from the REAL generated artifact's shapes
 * (modx@production.json), not invented.
 *
 * Three failure modes are specific to this application and each
 * one has assertions here rather than a comment:
 *
 *   1. THE ENVIRONMENT MODX CANNOT READ. The PHP-FPM the web role runs under reads no environment,
 *      so an actuator built the way the other four players built theirs reports `not set` for
 *      values that are present. Green's opposite, and just as wrong.
 *   2. RULE 1 IN THE OTHER DIRECTION. Not leaking a VALUE is the easy half. The handed artifact
 *      names its group entries by canonical-derived identities — `vault:infra/modx_storage_token`
 *      is an entry KEY there — and a row keyed by that string names the vault item to go after
 *      (@kuber). Rows are keyed by LOCAL names only.
 *   3. A PRESENCE VERDICT THAT IS THE FEATURE'S STATE. `kuber.reader_url` is documented as
 *      "empty = this plugin does nothing at all", so present/absent there publishes whether MODx
 *      pulls account numbers out of kuber at render time. The artifact spells that need TWO ways
 *      (its requires/consumes merge misses group members); both must be caught.

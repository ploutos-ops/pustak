# ── the ground's PHP, not this machine's ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# infra ruled on 2026-08-13: on the staging ground the PHP that matters is the one
# INSIDE the MODx container, and they render MODX_PHP_RUN='docker exec -i modx-staging php'. This
# repository ignored that variable entirely — the eight php suites were launched with a bare `php`,
# which on that host is either the wrong runtime or none.
#
# PATH FORM, DELIBERATELY: `$PHP_RUN tests/x.php`, never `$PHP_RUN < tests/x.php`. Measured
# 2026-08-13: all eight suites read their own location (__DIR__, dirname(), relative require) and
# `php < file` sets __FILE__ to "Standard input code", so every one of them would fail to find the
# files it checks. The path form means the ground must make this checkout visible to whatever runs
# the PHP — for a container, a read-only bind-mount at the same path. That is a property of the
# ground.
PHP_RUN=${MODX_PHP_RUN:-php}
REPO=$(pwd)

# EVERY php suite runs on the ground's PHP, and by ABSOLUTE path.
#
# Two measurements from hanuman, 2026-08-14, replacing two guesses of mine in one day:
#   * `docker exec … php tests/jump-nav.php` -> "Could not open input file". The container starts
#     in its own WORKDIR, so a relative path is resolved against the wrong directory even with the
#     checkout mounted. Absolute, and the mount puts it at the same path on both sides.
#   * storage-identity and sso-provider-per-context died exit 255 under the HOST's php:
#     "thrown in common/lib/StorageIdentity.php:57" and "SsoConfig.php:193" — CURLOPT_SSLCERT and
#     curl_init(). The host PHP has no curl extension; the container's does, because it serves the
#     site. A suite that exercises the site's library must run on the PHP that runs the site.
# So the earlier split (bootstrap vs not) was the wrong axis. The axis is: does it exercise the
# APPLICATION. All eight do.

# ── --before-apply: what a DEPLOY may run, on any ground, before it applies ─────
#
# A deploy verb runs as `automation` on the ground it deploys to, and on production that ground
# holds production's schema. Most suites above are BENCH suites: tests/lib.sh addresses
# ${MODX_DB_NAME:-modx} at localhost by socket, and protect-on-save creates and removes resources
# through MODX's own processors. Run by a production deploy, that is a write to production data
# (infra's objection, 2026-10-06). So a deploy does not run the whole list; it runs THIS
# one, and nothing in it may reach anything but this checkout and a temporary directory.
#
# HOW A SUITE GETS ON THIS LIST, and why the list is short. Each one passed with no network, the
# database socket hidden and every MODX_* variable removed (tests/before-apply-touches-nothing.sh
# proves that on every run of the bench list), AND names no database, socket, container, docroot
# or URL in its own text. Several suites pass the first test and fail the second — they use a
# database or a URL when the ground offers one — and they stay off: estate-clean, settings-guard,
# actuator-verdicts, storage-identity, login-card-renders, suites-accept-their-ground,
# sso-provider-per-context. A suite is added here only after both are true of it.
#
# THE MODE IS STRICT where the bench list is lenient: a suite that REFUSES (exit 2) is red here,
# because a carrier that passes on "could not check" is a gate that fails open. Every suite runs
# with an empty environment (PATH and a temporary HOME only), so a ground's MODX_DB_* or MODX_ROOT
# cannot reach it whatever the verb's shell holds. MODX_PHP_RUN is honoured for the php suites, as
# the bench list honours it, because the PHP that matters is the ground's.

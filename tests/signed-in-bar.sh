# signed-in-bar.sh — the estate title bar and the jump links, on a REAL signed-in page.
#
#     bash tests/signed-in-bar.sh
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS, stated plainly because it is a confession. Library's bar and its in-page
# navigation live on the SIGNED-IN surface, and until tonight nothing in this repo could open that
# surface. So every acceptance of the bar rested on the owner looking at it — repeatedly, over two
# sessions, for a thing a suite can read in four seconds. It cost twice in one evening:
#
#   * an agent reported "Library's bar is red on production" from a DEV BENCH, where an undeclared
#     ground correctly wears the red, and nothing mechanical existed to contradict it;
#   * every jump link on every page was dead for two sessions (5198af1 wrapped the content in an
#     `overflow-y:auto` shell, so `window.scrollTo` became a no-op) and NOTHING said so — the
#     handler ran, preventDefault() had already cancelled the browser's own jump, and the click was
#     silently spent. The owner found it by clicking TOGAF.
#
# Both are the same shape: a surface only a person could see, so a person was the instrument.
#
# WHAT IT ASSERTS, on the bench, signed in for real through mock-oidc:
#
#   the shared stylesheet is LINKED from the ground's own estate_cdn_url  (never a literal)
#   the bar carries data-env = the ground's own estate_env
#   the app name slot says Library, and the tenant slot names the context
#   estate_env_color SET    -> the bar emits style="--estate-env-color: <it>"
#   estate_env_color EMPTY  -> the bar emits NO style attribute at all, so the stylesheet's
#                              undeclared red is what an undeclared ground wears
#   a page with sections carries jump links, and the handler asks the TARGET to scroll itself
#   (scrollIntoView) rather than scrolling the window, which the app shell makes a no-op
#
# The colour is drilled IN BOTH DIRECTIONS against this ground's own setting, and the setting is
# put back exactly as it was found — including "absent", which is not the same as empty.
#
# BENCH ONLY. It signs in as a real person without their password, which is only possible because
# the bench's provider is mock-oidc; require_mock_idp refuses anywhere else.

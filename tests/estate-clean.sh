# THE RULE (the owner, 2026-08-01): "the repo needs to be clean of estate", and the mechanism he named:
# "an estate file can update the basic config file and rest can be driven from there."
#
# Words do not survive a fresh agent. This is the enforcement. It fails the moment somebody puts an
# estate value back into the software — a real person, a real address, a real credential — which is
# exactly how the declaration ended up inline the first time: one value at a time, each reasonable.
#
# It also proves the loader BOTH WAYS, because a check that can only pass is worse than no check:
# every refusal below is exercised by inducing the fault and asserting the non-zero exit.

# 2. No estate identifier in the software directories.
#    The kuber hostname added 2026-08-04: it was inline SEVEN TIMES in
#    common/chunks/kuber.js, one screen below the corp address phase 1 replaced, and this check
#    went green over every one of them because the pattern did not name it. A list of literals is
#    only as good as the last person to extend it — which is why the check below is the enforcement
#    and this comment is not.
#
#    `install/` AND `seat/` ARE NOT EXCLUDED — THEY ARE NOT HERE (phase 3, 2026-08-10). Both
#    were excluded for months as "the estate's own content, moving to the estate repository in
#    phase 2", and the exclusion did what every exclusion does: it made this check silent exactly
#    where the estate was. `install/modx-docroot.tar.gz` carried EIGHT estate addresses for eleven
#    days — seven kuber hosts and one corp host in a July build of a docroot asset — while source
#    was fixed and this suite was green. They now live in the estate repository, so there is
#    nothing to exclude and nothing to grep: check 10 below asserts that directly, because
#    "the directory is gone" and "the directory is excluded" look identical from inside a green run.
#
#    The estate repository's own copies are NOT checked here, deliberately. `seat/documents` is his
#    writing — his pages, his addresses — and a check that forbade estate identifiers in his content
#    would forbid his content. The tarball is a binary a grep cannot open; that half is enforced
#    where it is built (`setup/regenerate-docroot.sh` aborts and deletes it).
# The identifiers are the ESTATE's (estate.json `identifiers`), so the software names none of them.

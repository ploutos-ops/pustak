#!/usr/bin/env bash
# protect-on-save.sh — a page created in the manager is protected before anyone can read it.
#
#     bash tests/protect-on-save.sh
#
# WHAT IS UNDER TEST. `setup/04-access-control.py` converges access control at DEPLOY time, and a
# manager save triggers no job at all — so until the `protectOnSave` plugin existed, a page the owner
# wrote was public until the next deploy of anything. That is not theoretical: on 2026-07-29
# a fund balance sheet written that afternoon returned 200 to an anonymous request on production.
#
# THE ASSERTION THAT MATTERS IS THE LAST ONE IN EACH BLOCK: an anonymous request gets 401. Every
# other check here — the membership row, the group id — could pass with the page still serving. A
# membership without a covering grant is not protection, it is a black hole, and only a request can
# tell the two apart.
#
# THE OTHER DIRECTION IS WORSE, AND IT IS CHECKED TOO. Protecting the `support` subtree locks the
# door from the inside: an anonymous request to a protected sign-in page goes 401 -> unauthorized
# (sso-login) -> 401 until PHP dies at its memory limit and the server answers 500. So a page
# created under `support` must come out anonymous AND still answer 200.
#
# Resources are created through **MODX's own create processor**, not by INSERT: the event is the
# thing under test, and an INSERT fires nothing. The processor runs as the sudo admin in the mgr
# context, which is what a manager save is.
#
# BENCH ONLY. Creates four resources and removes them, restores `access.model` byte-for-byte.

# ── (2b) THE OTHER EXEMPTION: a declared MACHINE DOOR stays anonymous across a save ───
# A support page must answer anonymously or nobody can sign in. A machine door must answer
# anonymously or its own CODE never runs — and that code is the door. `/actuator/info` reads a
# client certificate in `common/snippets/actuatorInfo.php` and refuses everyone else with 401; page
# protection sits one layer above it and answers 302 to the sign-in page instead, for a valid
# certificate exactly as for none. That was measured by infra on 2026-09-05,
# from the ground that holds monitoring's certificate.
#
# 04 converges the exemption at deploy time. THIS is the half 04 cannot cover: a manager save fires
# no job, so if the plugin does not know about machine doors it re-shuts the door the next time
# anybody touches that page — and nothing would notice until the monitor lost its actuator.
#
# THE DOOR IS DECLARED BY URI AND THE PROBE PAGE'S URI IS ONLY KNOWN AFTER IT EXISTS, so the page is
# created first, its own uri is added to the rendered declaration, and it is SAVED AGAIN. That also
# exercises the direction that matters more: the plugin must REMOVE a membership that is already
# there, not merely decline to add one. The declaration is restored at the end of the block and by
# the exit trap, byte-for-byte, exactly as block (4) does.

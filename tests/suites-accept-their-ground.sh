#
# The bench was a MODx install on somebody's workstation, so every suite here could assume one
# machine held the schema, the docroot and the web server. The owner, 2026-08-12: "MODx is not needed
# on a local box for anything" — the bench became MODx staging on its own host, and infra measured
# what that did:
#
#     hanuman     /opt/modx/html          the docroot and the HTTP ground
#     shyam       the staging db name     THE SCHEMA IS ON ANOTHER MACHINE
#
# `lib.sh` ran `mysql -u … -p… "$DB_NAME"` with NO HOST, so it could only ever reach a database on
# the box running the test. No single ground satisfies both while the suites address localhost —
# which is why ten of twenty suites run nowhere, and why infra stopped before building the runner
# rather than build one that would report ten refusals forever.
#
# This is the static half of ask 3, and it exists because the fix is three lines that anybody could
# undo without noticing. It asserts the SHAPE, on any machine, with no database:
#
#   1. q() passes a host, and that host comes from the environment
#   2. the two suites that reached into /srv/local/modx read $MODX_ROOT instead
#   3. MODX_INSTALL_DIR is REFUSED rather than ignored
#
# On (3): infra's ask named the variable MODX_INSTALL_DIR. It is MODX_ROOT — already declared in
# service.json as `path:modx/docroot`, already read by jump-nav.php, 11-add-context.py and
# bench-domains.py. Two names for one fact is what rule 18 exists to stop, and the
# cost here is concrete rather than theoretical: a runner that sets one while the suites read the
# other gets a silent default and reports green against a machine nobody meant. So the second name
# is refused out loud, which turns a green-against-the-wrong-box into a one-line fix.
#
# KNOWN GAP, stated because it changes what a green line here is worth: the estate's shared
# drift-checker does NOT scan tests/lib.sh — a deliberately planted undeclared read there passes
# manifest-drift.sh. So the env vars this file asserts are not covered by that gate; this suite is
# the only thing watching them. Reported to infra.

# ── 2. no suite reaches into a hardcoded docroot ────────────────────────────────────────────────
# /srv/local is a dev-box convention. It does not exist on hanuman, where the docroot now
# lives — and the log-directory assertion in clear-cache-reaches-contexts.sh had a second clause
# that PASSES when there is no cache directory at all, so on that ground it would have gone green
# precisely because it was looking at the wrong machine.
#
# TWO EXEMPTIONS, both narrow and both stated rather than silently coded:
#   - the literal appearing as MODX_ROOT's DEFAULT: `${MODX_ROOT:-/srv/local/modx}` or
#     `getenv('MODX_ROOT') ?: '/srv/local/modx'`. The ask asks for defaults that leave a dev-box run
#     unchanged, so the default is the deliverable, not the defect.
#     MATCHED AS THE DEFAULT EXPRESSION, not as "the line mentions MODX_ROOT". The first version of
#     this exempted the whole line, and a drill proved it worthless: replacing ONE of the two
#     $MODX_ROOT references on the log-directory line with the old literal left the word MODX_ROOT
#     still on the line, and the check stayed green over a genuine hardcode.

# EACH CASE IN ITS OWN PROCESS. The first version sourced lib.sh into THIS shell to reach
# origin_of — which also ran lib.sh's `export MODX_ROOT=...`, so the MODX_INSTALL_DIR refusal three
# checks below stopped firing and reported the guard as broken. A check that changes the
# environment the later checks are about is the same defect as a check that supplies its own
# condition; both were in this file today.
# ── EVERY sub-shell below runs in a SCRUBBED environment ───────────────────────────────────────
# These checks ask what lib.sh does with a given set of variables. On a dev box the shell has
# none of them, so `MODX_DB_PASS=probe bash -c ...` asked exactly that. ON A REAL GROUND IT DOES
# NOT: the staging runner exports MODX_DB_*, MODX_ROOT, MODX_ESTATE and MODX_PHP_RUN, the
# sub-shell inherits them, and four checks in this file went red on hanuman's first run —
# 'MODX_INSTALL_DIR was accepted', 'a remote host was accepted with the dev box's defaults',
# 'the local path changed' — none of which were true of lib.sh. They were true of the shell.
#
# So `probe` strips every MODX_* and sets only what the case is about. A check that passes on a
# dev box and fails on a ground is testing the shell, which is the defect this whole suite is
# about (measured 2026-08-14 from the ground's own journal).
# This suite runs standalone (it is ABOUT lib.sh, so it cannot source it and inherit the very

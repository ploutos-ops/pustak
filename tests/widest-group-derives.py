"""widest-group-derives — the group that may enter EVERY context is derived, not hand-listed.

THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES. `estate.json` named `allContextMember`'s contexts literally:

    "allContextMember": [["family", "corporate", "worldview", "claude"], ["alice"]]

beside `domains.contexts`, which listed the same four. So a fifth context could be declared,
installed, and served, and the one group that is supposed to see everything would not cover it —
until somebody remembered to edit a second place. There was no field to ask and no check that could
go red: both lists were well-formed, and MODx would happily grant three contexts to a group whose
name promises all of them. That is the estate's recurring shape — a hand-kept copy of a fact that
has an owner elsewhere — and it was mine.

WHAT IS ASSERTED:
  - a group whose contexts are the single token `*` covers every context `domains.contexts`
    declares;
  - ADDING a context to `domains.contexts` widens that group with NO edit to `groups` — the
    property the fix exists for, and the one a hand-listed group fails;
  - an explicit list is still honoured exactly, so a group meant to see one site keeps seeing one;
  - `*` beside a named context REFUSES at import, because one of the two would be silently
    ignored;
  - `*` with no declared contexts REFUSES, rather than granting a group nothing under a name that
    says everything.

A known-answer control runs first. Reads only: this stands up no database.

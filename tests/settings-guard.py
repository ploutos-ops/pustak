"""settings-guard — proves setup/settings_guard.py refuses a pass that empties a setting.

Three times in one day a setup pass cleared settings nobody asked it to touch, and every one was
found by a person or an agent stumbling into it rather than by the pass reporting anything. The
guard is the answer; this is the proof it works, and it is the half that matters, because a guard
nobody has watched go red is a decoration.

IT RUNS ON A DEV BOX, deliberately. Ten of this repository's twenty suites refuse for want of a
bench and that refusal is correct — "could not check" and "checked, and it is fine" are
different answers. But a guard proven only where infra has not built the ground yet is a guard
proven nowhere. This one can be proven honestly here, because it needs a database with two tables
in it, not a MODx.

WHICH ENGINE, AND IT SAYS SO IN ITS OWN OUTPUT. By default it builds the two tables in a private
sqlite file and drops it. That is not the engine the passes use, so the difference is printed on
every run rather than buried here: what the guard executes is two plain SELECTs and a rollback,
which both engines implement identically, but nobody should have to read this file to know which
one a green line came from. Point it at the real thing to remove the gap:

    MODX_DRILL_DSN='mysql://user@/schema?unix_socket=/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock'  python3 tests/settings-guard.py

On this dev box that is not possible today and the reason is not a defect in the drill: the account
holds no CREATE grant (the box is infra's), so there is no schema it may build tables
in. On the staging ground infra was asked for, there is.

EVERY DRILL IS A REAL PASS: it opens a connection, writes through it, and ends at the guard. The
guard is never handed a hand-made dictionary — that would prove the comparison and not the thing
the passes actually do.

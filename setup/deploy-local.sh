# deploy-local.sh — deploy the local bench FROM A GIT REF, the way production is deployed.
#
# The owner, 2026-09-18, after the bench carried documents that no push had made public: "what is
# the source of git for this operation. a local copy or master git … should it pull first."
#
# Two acts, two names. PREVIEW reads the working tree (`import.py`, `seat/push.py`) and is for an
# edit not yet committed. DEPLOY reads a named ref after a fetch, so what lands on the bench is
# what Gitea holds — the same discipline as infra's apply-modx-elements.sh, which archives the
# ref into a scratch directory and applies from there. Nothing uncommitted rides along.
#
#   setup/deploy-local.sh [--ref origin/master] [--estate-ref origin/master] [--elements-only|--documents-only]
#
# Order matters and is fixed here: documents first (seat/push.py also writes the seat's element
# copies, which are production's), then elements from common/, then the cache.
#
# Ground: MODX_ROOT (no default — name the bench, as make-current.sh and modx-snapshot.sh do),
# MODX_DB_SOCKET (default /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock), the software repo beside this file, and the
# estate repo beside it as ../modx-estate unless MODX_ESTATE_REPO names another checkout.

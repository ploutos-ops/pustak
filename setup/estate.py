estate.py — THE LOADER. It holds no estate.

WHAT CHANGED AND WHY (the owner, 2026-08-01: *"the repo needs to be clean of estate"* /
*"an estate file can update the basic config file and rest can be driven from there"*).

Until today this file WAS the estate: three contexts, three real people, their groups and their
landing pages, written inline. An earlier change had already separated it from the installer scripts, which was
the right first move and not enough — a declaration living inside the software repository is still
the software carrying somebody's estate around. It also made the repository unlicensable: you
cannot give away code that has a family's names in it.

So the split is now the one the owner described. **The software ships a generic default. An estate file
overlays it. Everything downstream reads the result and knows nothing about estates.**

    no MODX_ESTATE set        -> the DEFAULT below: no contexts, no users, no groups.
                                 A stock install produces an empty, working, generic estate.
                                 This is the install-from-nothing path and it stays proven.

    MODX_ESTATE=/path/to.json -> that file is loaded and overlaid on the default.
                                 It must exist and parse, or this refuses. A named estate that
                                 silently falls back to the empty one would install a stranger's
                                 software over somebody's data and report success.

Every consumer keeps its existing import (`from estate import CONTEXTS, USERS, ...`) — the names
and their shapes are unchanged, so nothing downstream had to be rewritten to make the repository
clean. That is deliberate: a seam that forces thirty edits is a seam that gets reverted.

THE FORMAT is `estate.example.json`, which is generic and committed here as documentation. The real
estate file is NOT in this repository and must never be added to it; `.gitignore` refuses
`estate.json` for that reason.

Import-safe: declarations only, no database connection, no side effects beyond reading one file.

#
# Load + bind + verify are ONE operation here, deliberately. The seed carries the BENCH hosts by
# design; binding the target profile used to be a separate hand-run step (setup/10 on prod), and a
# seed load that skipped it left production resolving on the bench names with nothing complaining
# ("if you hardcode a domain it must be overwritten on upload"). Words in a runbook did not
# survive; this does: the load cannot succeed without the bind, and the bind is asserted afterwards.
#
# Scope: DB only — schema, content, and the domain binding. Files (docroot tar), machine config,
# nginx, DNS and cache belong to the caller: setup/make-current.sh on the bench,
# docs/production-install.md on prod. Idempotent: the seed's DROP TABLEs replace whatever was there.
#
# Config is env-driven with the dev-box values as defaults (see docs/installation.md):
#   MODX_DB_HOST / MODX_DB_USER / MODX_DB_PASS / MODX_DB_NAME, MODX_ROOT (cache clear).
# FORCE=1 overwrites a DB that already holds resources; without it a populated DB is refused.

# ── The estate title bar's two configured values ──────────────────────────────────────
# MODx elements are the SAME BYTES on every ground — apply-modx-elements.sh deploys one file to
# bench, staging and production alike — so nothing per-ground can be baked into a chunk. The render
# point that does exist is a system setting read as [[++key]], which is the shape dev's spec names
# for this application (claude/shared/design/estate-title-bar.md).
#
# estate_cdn_url  WHERE THE ESTATE CDN IS. Infra's fact, not Library's: the day it moves, this one
#                 value moves. Taken from the environment when the caller supplies it, so a ground
#                 can be told rather than assume. Without it the ground KEEPS the value it already
#                 holds (the software carries no estate's address); a fresh install with neither
#                 gets none, and the line printed below says which of the three it was.
# estate_env      WHICH GROUND THIS IS. It decides the bar's colour and its word, so a wrong value
#                 is a person acting on the wrong ground. The default is 'development' ON PURPOSE:
#                 an unset value then shows amber and the word DEVELOPMENT — visibly wrong — rather
#                 than inheriting production's indigo and production's silence, which is the failure
#                 that cannot be seen.

# estate_env_color  THE COLOUR OF THE ENVIRONMENT THIS GROUND IS IN. Infra renders
#                 ESTATE_ENV_COLOR from one row per ENVIRONMENT (config 995846df); topNavBar puts
#                 it on the bar as the custom property --estate-env-color, which every colour rule
#                 in the shared stylesheet reads BEFORE any environment name. So a new environment
#                 costs infra one row and costs this repo nothing, which is the whole rule.
#                 EMPTY IS NOT A COLOUR: infra renders the empty string for an environment with no
#                 row, and an empty setting makes the chunk write no property at all, so the bar
#                 falls through to --estate-env-undeclared — the red that says nobody declared this
#                 ground. Writing `--estate-env-color: ` instead would be a declaration of nothing
#                 that still beats the fallback, which is the failure this exists to prevent.

# ── RETIRED SETTINGS: rows this file used to declare and now DELETES ──────────────────────────
# A row nobody declares any more must not simply be abandoned. This file upserts, so dropping a
# key from `settings` leaves it on every ground it was ever written to, where the next reader finds
# a value with no declaration behind it and cannot tell whether it is load-bearing. So a key leaves
# by being named HERE, and the same verb that wrote it removes it.
#
# `debug` and `error_reporting` were declared by this file from 2026-06-05 (e027e33, the first
# import of these scripts) with no reason recorded — the shape of a line written while setting a
# thing up and never revisited. The owner, 2026-09-20, on being shown they do nothing: "if we do not
# need it, can we remove it."
#
# THEY DO NOTHING ON 3.2.4, measured rather than assumed. `modX::setDebug('1')` matches none of
# true/'true'/'-1'/false/'false'/'0', falls to `intval(constant('1'))` = 0, and `if ($debug)` is
# false — no call is made (core/src/Revolution/modX.php:737-757). Nothing under core/src reads a
# setting named `error_reporting` at all.
#
# DELETED RATHER THAN SET TO '0', AND THE DIFFERENCE IS THE WHOLE POINT. '0' DOES match that
# branch and calls `error_reporting(0)`, which silences every PHP error on the ground — a real
# regression dressed as a tidy-up. An ABSENT row means `getOption('debug')` is null and
# `setDebug` is never called, which is exactly today's behaviour minus the misleading row.
#
# A RETIRE NEEDS A CACHE REFRESH, exactly as any settings change does: MODx serves settings from
# core/cache/system_settings/config.cache.php, so the row goes and the old value is still answered
# until the cache is rebuilt. Measured on the bench — after the DELETE, getOption('debug') still
# returned '1'; after clear-cache.php it returned NULL, with getDebug() false and error_reporting()
# 22527 both BEFORE and AFTER, which is the proof that removing the row changes no behaviour.
#
# `sso.allowed_emails` and `sso.allowed_domains`: the sign-in list that sat in front of the
# MODx user check. The owner, 2026-10-05, after a restore carried production's one-address list onto the
# bench and refused his other accounts: "let us say i want to get rid of this additional list" /
# "please do". GoogleSSOCallback no longer reads either, so the rows are deleted on every ground.

"""
The access model — ONE declaration, imported by everything that writes or checks it.

`04-access-control.py` WRITES this model into a MODx database; `verify-file-protection.py` ASSERTS
that a database still matches it. They must never carry separate copies of the same facts: a
watcher that keeps its own list of contexts, group names or policy ids goes green on a model it no
longer describes, and a false green on file protection means the estate's documents are open while
the board says they are shut.

Import-safe on purpose — declarations only, no database connection, no side effects. `04` cannot be
imported (it does its work at module level), which is exactly why the shared facts live here.

WHAT IS AND IS NOT IN THIS FILE. This file is the access POLICY — the shape of the model,
and the switches that turn protection on and off. WHO the estate is for — its contexts, its people,
their groups and landing pages — is `estate.py`, and is re-exported below so every existing consumer
keeps importing it from here. The split exists because those two things have different audiences: an
outsider installing this software edits `estate.py` and never needs to read this file, while the
policy below is the same for every installation.

# The same switch, one level up, and for the same reason the owner gave for the files: "i can always
# unlock the doors and it is a simpler option than finding doors to be locked."
#
# The old rule was "only home is protected, all others open". It was never true in practice — the
# three ids in allContextProtected were 13/27/41, the deleted 'home' twins, so the group protected
# nothing at all and every page in the estate answered an anonymous curl with 200. Measured, both
# directions: a static in a protected group returns 401, a document in no group returns 200.
#
# True = every PAGE needs a signed-in member of its own context, except the support subtree.
# False + a re-run of 04 lifts it in one step, memberships and grants dropped together.
PROTECT_PAGES = True
DOC_CLASS = 'MODX\\Revolution\\modDocument'

# The exception set, and it is mechanical rather than a list anyone maintains: each context has one
# top-level `support` container holding login, logout, sso-login, sso-logout, unauthorized, error,
# robots, search, userHome and public. Those must answer anonymously or nobody can sign in, reach
# the unauthorized page, or be redirected by the router — protecting them locks the door from the
# inside. Nothing is nested below them (checked), so "the container and its children" is the whole
# rule and a page added to support later is exempt automatically.
SUPPORT_ALIAS = 'support'

# ── MACHINE DOORS — the pages MODx's access model must NOT judge ───────────────────
# The second exception, and it is a different reason from `support`, so it is a different rule and
# not an extra alias in the container above.
#
# A `support` page must answer anonymously or nobody can SIGN IN. A machine door must answer
# anonymously or its OWN CODE never runs — and that code is the door. `/actuator/info` is admitted
# by a client certificate read in `common/snippets/actuatorInfo.php`, which refuses every caller it
# does not recognise with 401 and a fixed message. Page protection intercepts one layer above that
# and answers 302 to the sign-in page instead, for a valid certificate exactly as for none, so the
# element's own refusal is never reached and neither is its acceptance.
#
# THAT IS NOT A HYPOTHETICAL. Measured 2026-09-05 by
# infra from the ground that holds monitoring's certificate — nginx VERIFIED the chain and logged
# `dn="CN=monitoring@production"`, and MODx answered 302 to /sso-login regardless. Reproduced on a
# dev box the same way round: with the actuator rows present and 04 NOT yet run, `/actuator/info`
# answers 401 from the element; after 04 it answers `302 -> /sso-login?returnUrl=%2Factuator%2Finfo`.
#
# ONE OWNER, AND IT IS THE MANIFEST. `service.json` already declares which paths this application
# offers a MACHINE (`identity.routes`, P10) — that is the same fact, so it is read from there rather
# than restated here. Adding a route row to the manifest therefore un-protects that page, which is a
# real widening and is why it is bounded in BOTH directions:
#   - 04 PRINTS every row it exempts, by id and uri, so an exemption nobody meant is visible in the
#     deploy output rather than inferred from a count;
#   - `verify-file-protection.py` asserts both directions — a declared door that is IN the protected
#     group is drift (the door is shut), and a page that is open and is NOT a declared door is drift
#     (it serves to anyone). An undeclared page cannot become exempt by being open.
# A route row is not a licence on its own: the element behind it still has to refuse, and that is
# proven by `consumer-reach.sh` — the rule-21 artefact, which calls the door with each declared
# consumer's certificate and with none. Four owners, no overlap: this file declares the exemption,
# `verify-file-protection.py` asserts the database matches it, `tests/protect-on-save.sh` proves a
# manager save cannot re-shut it, and `consumer-reach.sh` proves the element still refuses.

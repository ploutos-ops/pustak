#
# The seed is a full DB dump (schema + config + elements + RBAC + content + TV values). Because it
# is a full dump, any secret-bearing system setting present at dump time would land in git. This
# script makes the safe path the only path: the known secret settings are EXCLUDED FROM THE DUMP, so
# no credential can ever be committed. On production those same settings are injected AFTER loading
# the seed, from the environment (setup/12-sso.py, setup/13-storage-gate.py) — never from the seed.
#
# BENCH ONLY. Guarded to refuse if the DB looks like production (http_host not in the bench zone).
#
# READ-ONLY ON ITS SOURCE. This script issues no UPDATE, TRUNCATE or DELETE. It used to blank the
# secret settings and truncate the log tables IN THE BENCH DATABASE before dumping, which meant
# building the artifact broke the box it was built on — whoever's bench it was lost SSO sign-in
# until setup/12-sso.py was re-run, and lost their sessions. The exclusions now happen in the DUMP,
# by dumping in three passes, so the bench is untouched and stays usable.
#
# NOT YET MECHANICALLY ENFORCED: nothing stops a future edit reintroducing a write. The real guard
# is a MySQL user holding only SELECT + LOCK TABLES on the modx database, which is infra's to grant
# (asked for). Until then this is a convention, and conventions do not survive a fresh agent.

# --- what the dump deliberately leaves out ------------------------------------------------------
#
# SECRET-BEARING SETTINGS. Omitted from the dump ENTIRELY, not carried as empty strings. Both
# injectors (setup/12-sso.py, setup/13-storage-gate.py) are upserts — `set_setting()` creates the
# row when it is absent — so a seed that never mentions the key produces the same end state as one
# carrying it blank, and cannot leak. Absent is also a stronger post-condition to verify than empty.
SECRET_KEYS=(sso.google_client_id sso.google_client_secret storage.modx_token)
#
# THE SAME PROBLEM ONE TABLE OVER, and it was latent rather than harmless. Everything above filters
# `modx_system_settings`. Now the per-context identity provider writes its credential as a
# CONTEXT setting — `12-sso.py` set_ctx() writes `sso.oidc_client_secret` into
# `modx_context_setting`, once per gated context — and that table was in pass 2, dumped whole.
#
# Nothing has leaked: measured 2026-08-20, `zcat install/modx-seed.sql.gz | grep -c 'sso.oidc'`
# is 0, because no ground that had run the oidc path had ever regenerated a seed. That is luck
# expiring, not a design: the first regeneration from any oidc-configured ground would have put
# one client secret per context into git, and the check above would have passed while it happened,
# because it reads a different table.
#
# So context settings get their own pass and their own two assertions, the negative and the
# positive, for the same reasons written out above.
CONTEXT_SECRET_KEYS=(sso.oidc_client_secret)  # pragma: allowlist secret
# The pragma is on a line whose ONLY content is the NAME of a setting to exclude — the push
# door's scan reads `<SOMETHING>_KEYS=` as an assignment and the 24 characters after it as a
# value. Same shape as SECRET_KEYS above, which predates the scan and is therefore never in a
# diff. Left visible rather than reworded, because `git grep 'allowlist secret'` is how every
# exception in this estate is meant to be findable.
#
# SYSTEM LOG TABLES (the owner, 2026-07-26): "feel free to delete history tables of system. deprecation
# log, session log, manager log." These are runtime volumes, not app state, and a seed is the
# blessed STARTING state of a machine — it has no business carrying the previous machine's login
# sessions or its manager audit trail. `modx_manager_log` in particular records who changed what on
# production; committing it to git put prod activity history in a repository for no benefit.
#
# Their SCHEMA is still dumped (pass 1) — only their rows are skipped. Doing this at dump time
# rather than by truncating first makes the guarantee unconditional: there is no window in which the
# bench re-accumulates rows between the truncate and the dump, which is exactly what happened the
# first time (the "emptied" seed still carried one session and one deprecation row).
#
# The estate's own log-clearing migration still exists and is still the right tool for
# PRODUCTION, where the point is to discard history deliberately after a backup. This is the seed's
# own hygiene, not that.

# The scope of this check is load-bearing twice over, and both were found by the check firing
# falsely rather than by reasoning:
#
#   * NOT the whole dump. The SSO snippet's own source calls
#     $modx->getOption('sso.google_client_id', ...) and mysqldump writes that code out verbatim, so
#     across the full artifact the text ('sso.google_client_id', occurs in both a settings row and a
#     snippet body, byte-identical. No pattern separates them; only scope does.
#   * NOT the whole of pass 3. mysqldump echoes its own --where clause as a comment:
#         -- WHERE:  `key` NOT IN ('sso.google_client_id',...)
#     so a checker reading comments finds the secret in the very line that proves it was excluded,
#     and aborts every legitimate run.
#   * NOT the lines beginning `INSERT INTO` either. mysqldump ends that line at VALUES and writes
#     the row tuples on the lines BELOW it, so anchoring on INSERT selects a header carrying no
#     data — every key reads as missing and the secret reads as absent. That version passed its
#     secret check for the wrong reason, which is the failure mode worth naming.
#
# Dropping comment and blank lines leaves LOCK/INSERT/UNLOCK and the row tuples — settings data and
# nothing else. Verified against controls: real data -> 0 missing keys and 3 secrets absent; a row
# with a secret spliced in -> caught; a single key removed -> reported missing.

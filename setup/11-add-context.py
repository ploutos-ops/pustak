"""11 — Add a new MODx context end to end (reusable, idempotent).

Creates a context + its settings + a startup document + anonymous access, so a fresh context
resolves by host and serves a page. This is the codified "add a context" process (rehearsed on
the bench; infra runs the prod-side DNS/vhost + this script on the container).

ROUTING (2026-09-15): name->context is the EDGE's, not this script's. `config.context.php`
is one line requiring EdgeContext.php, which takes the context from the X-Tenant header nginx sets
from the name's `upstream_key` (a bench port door: BENCH_TENANT). A fresh context serves once the
edge sends its key; until then its names answer the estate's 404. This script writes the DB rows
only: context + settings + startup doc + uri + anon access. (It used to patch a host map into
config.context.php under PATCH_CONFIG_CONTEXT=1; there is no map any more.)

The context to add and its bench host come from CTX_KEY / CTX_HOST; neither has a default.
Override CTX_* in the env to add a different one. Bench host is *.modx on the internal zone; prod host is bound
by setup/10-production-domains.py + infra's config.context.php template (add the context there too).

ACCESS MODEL — declared, not assumed. A context whose estate entry says `protected: true`
is built in the PROTECTED shape: `site_start` is its `userHome` (so an anonymous hit on the context
root is redirected to sign in, as the other protected contexts are), and `protected_page` +
`nav_root_id` name its landing page so 04 and the userHome snippet have a home to send a member to.
A context with no entry, or `protected: false`, keeps the OPEN-within-internal shape: anonymous gets
Load Only, no Protected resources, every page renders without a per-user login, and the network
(internal-only) is the boundary.

GATING ONE IS THREE SCRIPTS, NOT ONE, and getting that wrong has happened here before: declare it protected
in the estate file, then run **12** (the SSO doors — sso-login/callback/logout, and login_page +
unauthorized_page repointed at them) and **04** (the access model) and this script again. 04 alone
shuts the pages while `login_page` still names the retired form login, which locks the door from the
inside: the estate is SSO-only, so that page can authenticate nobody.

The old text here said "run the 04 access model for this context" and that is the sentence the
`claude` context was built on — it served 200 to the open internet for as long as it existed.

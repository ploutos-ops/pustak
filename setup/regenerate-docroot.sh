# The docroot tar is the complete, runnable, extension-complete MODx file tree. It and
# install/modx-seed.sql.gz are a MATCHED PAIR (same build, same MODx version) — production-install.md
# says so, and mixing a tar from one version with a seed from another is the failure this script
# exists to make unlikely. Regenerate both together, always.
#
# Written 2026-07-25 during the upgrade rehearsal. Until then this command lived in
# production-install.md as `tar czf … --exclude=core/cache --exclude=config.core.php …` — with the
# rest of the exclude list elided behind an ellipsis. A regeneration command nobody can reproduce
# from the documentation is not a documented command.
#
# BENCH ONLY. Refuses if the tree's context bindings do not look like the bench, mirroring
# regenerate-seed.sh, because a tar built from a prod tree would carry prod machine config.

# --- what is deliberately NOT in the tar, and why ---------------------------------------------
#
#   core/cache/            runtime. Ships nothing; a stale cache on a new machine is worse than none.
#   config.core.php        machine config — infra writes it (it hardcodes the absolute core path).
#                          Excluded ANYWHERE in the tree, not just at the root: the 3.2.3 CLI
#                          upgrade also writes manager/config.core.php and connectors/config.core.php
#                          (both new — the pre-upgrade tree and the previous tar had neither), and
#                          each hardcodes this machine's absolute core path.
#   core/config/config.inc.php
#                          machine config — DB credentials, absolute paths, site_id. Never in git.
#   setup/                 the installer. Excluded since 2026-07-25 for two reasons:
#                          (1) our install path never runs it — production-install.md unpacks this
#                              tar and then loads the DB with setup/load-seed.sh; the seed IS the
#                              installed state, so setup/index.php has no job to do;
#                          (2) MODx's own ConfigCheck (core/src/Revolution/Processors/System/
#                              ConfigCheck.php) raises "Installer still present" on every manager
#                              dashboard for as long as the directory exists. Shipping it meant
#                              every freshly built machine came up already carrying that warning.
#                          An UPGRADE does need setup/ — you stage it from the release distribution
#                          at that point and delete it again afterwards. See docs/upgrades.md.
#
# Everything else is included on purpose, including core/components/{pdotools,simplesearch} and
# core/packages/ — that is what "extension-complete" means. If an extra is uninstalled on the bench,
# it correctly disappears from the next tar.

#   config.context.php     machine config of the ground, not software. It was the HTTP_HOST ->
#                          context map, a list of somebody's domains riding inside a software
#                          tarball; now it is the one-line EdgeContext require,
#                          rendered by infra's modx-web role or written on a bench by
#                              python3 setup/config-context.py --profile <p> --write <docroot>
#                          and asserted with `--check <docroot>`.

#   core/config/application.php
#                          machine config, the same class as config.inc.php: infra renders it on a
#                          managed ground (common/lib/Application.php), and on the bench it is a
#                          hand-written copy naming this box's identity directory. First present at
#                          the 3.2.4 regeneration; the August tar predates it.
#   core/protected/        the protected-files store — runtime content written by the storage path
#                          and by the suite's probes, never software. Same regeneration.
#   core/components/pustak/
#                          OUR library (common/lib/*.php). It reaches a ground through infra's
#                          modx-web ansible role, tag modx_lib (docs/HOW-IT-WORKS.md), so a copy in
#                          this tar is a second source that is stale from the day it is built. The
#                          bench carries it because the local rebuild copies it in by hand.

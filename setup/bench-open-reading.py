"""bench-open-reading — let an anonymous visitor READ a bench, and put it back.

WHY THIS EXISTS, stated plainly because it removes a protection.

A bench has no way to sign anyone in. Google refuses to issue a callback to a private name, and
the estate's mock-oidc provider guards on the internal zone suffix — a bench reached at
`localhost:<port>` over an ssh forward is neither. So the front-end `sso-login` answers "Single
sign-on is not configured", and every page carrying page protection returns the unauthorized page
instead of itself. The owner, 2026-08-20, opening the bench: *"not delivering anything on 8314"*. He
was right: a reviewing surface that can show four anonymous pages out of 1,545 is not one.

WHAT IT CHANGES. Exactly one thing, and only for resource groups you name: the ANONYMOUS
principal (user group 0) is moved from `Load Only` to `Load, List and View` on that group. No
user is created, no password exists, no policy is edited, no resource moves, and the group's other
grants are untouched — so a signed-in reader sees precisely what they saw before.

WHAT IT COSTS, and this is the half a caller must not skip: a bench in this state NO LONGER PROVES
THAT PROTECTION WORKS. That is one of the two things a bench is for. So it prints what it did in
words, it is reversible in one command, and `--check` will tell you which state a bench is in
before you trust a protection result measured on it.

**BENCH ONLY, mechanically.** It refuses unless the context's `site_url` names a loopback address:
a ground reachable by anyone else must never be opened this way, and asking the caller to be
careful is not a check. Production and staging both fail that test by construction.

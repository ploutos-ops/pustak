/**
 * unauthorizedNotice — what a person sees when MODx REFUSES a page.
 *
 * THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR. `unauthorized_page` and `login_page` are the same resource on every
 * gated context: setup/12 points both at the context's `sso-login` entry. Signed OUT that is
 * correct — you were refused, so go and sign in. Signed IN and not a member of the context it is a
 * loop with no exit and no explanation:
 *
 *     refused -> sso-login -> "already signed in" -> site_start -> refused -> sso-login -> …
 *
 * GoogleSSOStart returns a signed-in visitor to `site_start`, which on a protected context is
 * `userHome`, which routes them at a page they are still not allowed to see. The person is bounced
 * between two pages that each believe the other one will handle it, and neither ever says the one
 * fact that would end it: *this account is not a member of this area*. The owner met it himself on
 * staging on 2026-08-12; his membership was changed so he will not meet it again, which is exactly
 * why the behaviour is fixed here rather than left to be rediscovered by somebody without that fix.
 *
 * THE RULE IT OBEYS comes from one repo over, and it is the whole point: a failure a person is
 * shown must name itself — the real reason, or a reference that appears verbatim in a log. A
 * redirect names nothing at all, which is worse than a bare sentence: there is not even a string to
 * photograph and send to admissions.
 *
 * BEHAVIOUR, one branch per state of the visitor:
 *
 *   signed out          forward to the sign-in entry, carrying the page they were asking for as
 *                       returnUrl. This is what happens today and it is right; the only change is
 *                       that the deep link survives the round trip.
 *   signed in, refused  ACC-01. Name the account, name nothing else about the estate, offer the one
 *                       action that can work (sign out, sign in as somebody else) and never a
 *                       sign-in link — a sign-in link IS the loop.
 *   login_page missing  ACC-02. Rather than an empty href (an anchor with no target is
 *                       indistinguishable from a working one until it is clicked).
 *   login_page is THIS  ACC-03. Refuse to forward to ourselves. A misconfiguration that would
 *                       otherwise reproduce the very loop this snippet was written to end.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO: it never says which group or context would have been required,
 * and it never lists what else exists. The visitor is told about their own session and nothing
 * about the estate's shape — the same line GoogleSSOCallback's $deny draws, for the same reason.
 *
 * Placed as `[[!unauthorizedNotice]]` on each context's `sso-unauthorized` resource by setup/12,
 * which then points `unauthorized_page` at it. UNCACHED, always: the answer depends on who is
 * asking, and a cached copy would show one visitor's name to the next one.

// unstyled div while the page it forwards to was a card. `access-refused` is KEPT on the outer

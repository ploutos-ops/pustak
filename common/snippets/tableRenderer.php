/**
 * tableRenderer — render a table from JSON data held in the page, not from hand-written markup.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. A table typed as <td> is text forever: nothing can tell which column is an
 * email and which is a phone number. That is not theoretical — asked "who are my contacts at
 * the bank", the estate search returned the man's NAME and silently dropped his mobile and email
 * from the line below, because the page separated fields with a capital "I" on one line and a "|"
 * on the next. Same class of problem as two tables labelling what may be the same number "SSN" on
 * one and "EIN" on the other, where nothing can say which is right. Naming the fields removes the
 * ambiguity at the source instead of asking every reader to guess.
 *
 * WHERE THE DATA LIVES. In the page itself, in a block the browser ignores:
 *
 *   <script type="application/ld+json" id="contacts">
 *   [
 *     {"@type":"Person","name":"Alice Example","jobTitle":"Relationship Manager",
 *      "email":"someone@example.org","telephone":"+44 20 7946 0000"}
 *   ]
 *   </script>
 *
 *   [[!tableRenderer? &from=`contacts`]]
 *
 * Chosen over a TV, a chunk, or a separate resource because data and page stay in ONE seat file —
 * versioned, diffable, VSCode-editable, nothing hidden in the manager. `type="application/ld+json"`
 * is not JavaScript, so a browser neither renders nor executes it: if this snippet fails, the page
 * shows a missing table, never a wall of raw JSON. A CHUNK is still the right home for a list
 * shared across pages — pass it via &json instead.
 *
 * SCHEMA.ORG. The data is plain JSON, so anything works, but schema.org's vocabulary (name, email,
 * telephone, jobTitle, worksFor) is preferred where it fits: the names are already agreed, so they
 * do not get argued about later. Your own terms belong under your own namespace prefix
 * (e.g. "est:relationshipSince"). This snippet is deliberately TOLERANT — bare array, single
 * object, with or without @context/@type, or a JSON-LD @graph — so the data can grow richer
 * without this code changing.
 *
 * PROPERTIES
 *   &from     id of a <script type="application/(ld+)json"> block in THIS resource's content
 *   &json     the data directly — inline, or a chunk, e.g. &json=`[[$sharedContacts]]`
 *   &url      fetch the JSON from a URL at render time. For data that is REFRESHED BY SOMEONE
 *             ELSE on its own schedule — the backup status feed is regenerated every six
 *             hours by infra, and a copy pasted into the page would be as old as the last
 *             deploy. On a page whose whole subject is staleness, that is the one unacceptable
 *             failure. MUST be called uncached (`[[!tableRenderer`); a cached call is REFUSED,
 *             not quietly served, because MODx would freeze one fetch into the page cache and
 *             the table would then lie for as long as the cache lived.
 *             &urlTimeout seconds, default 3.
 *   &auth     name the AUDIENCE this call authenticates to, e.g. &auth=`kuber`. The fetch then
 *             carries `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` asserting WHO IS READING THE PAGE, and the
 *             audience answers with that person's own data.
 *
 *             WHY THIS EXISTS. The owner, on ~460 rows of account numbers, card numbers and
 *             SSNs typed into the estate's pages: *"request skunkworks/kuber to get sensitive
 *             information from kuber ... if not logged in, display blank."* He rejected the premise
 *             that the value belongs in the page in ANY form — not as prose, not as JSON-in-content.
 *             The page carries the id (`<span class="bird" kuberid="67012">` has for years); the
 *             audience carries the value; and *"each person has different access"*, so the value is
 *             fetched as the reader, never as the site.
 *
 *             WHAT IS ASSERTED, and it is deliberately the least this can honestly say:
 *               alg RS256 | iss modx | aud <the &auth name> | sub the reader's Google-verified
 *               email | iat now | exp now+60
 *             60 seconds because it is a request credential, not a session. Signed with the system
 *             setting `<audience>.jwt_private_key` — so `&auth=`kuber`` signs with
 *             `kuber.jwt_private_key`, and a second consumer is a second setting, not new code.
 *             The key is read at render time and never appears in output; the token is minted
 *             server-side, sent server-side, and NEVER reaches the browser.
 *
 *             THERE IS DELIBERATELY NO SNIPPET THAT RETURNS A TOKEN. Minting lives inside this
 *             file rather than in a shared `kuberAssertion` element because an element that returns
 *             a signed assertion can be written into a page — `[[!kuberAssertion]]` — and then the
 *             credential IS the page. Twenty duplicated lines in a future second consumer is a
 *             cheaper problem than an element in the estate that leaks identity on request.
 *
 *             WHO THE READER IS, established from two independent facts that must agree:
 *             MODx must hold an authenticated web session for this context, AND the session must
 *             carry the address Google verified (`$_SESSION['sso.verified_email']`, stamped by
 *             GoogleSSOCallback at the moment of sign-in), AND that address must be the one on the
 *             signed-in account. A manager-created local login has no verified address and is
 *             therefore nobody here — which is the point: the claim `sub` makes is "Google verified
 *             this person", and only the SSO path can support it. Anything less than all three ->
 *             no request is made at all. Not an unauthenticated fetch, not an empty table: silence,
 *             which is what "display blank" means when there is nobody to ask on behalf of.
 *
 *             A CREDENTIAL IS NEVER SENT IN CLEAR. https, or a host on loopback or the internal
 *             zone. The zone suffix is the owner's own rule from mock-oidc — a zone suffix is a
 *             property of the network, an FQDN is only a name — and it is reused here rather than
 *             re-decided. Anything else is refused before the socket opens.
 *   &rows     dot-path to the array of rows inside the document, e.g. `jobs` or `data.items`.
 *             Real feeds wrap their rows in an envelope carrying metadata — the backup feed is
 *             {"generated": "...", "jobs": [...]} — and without this the envelope itself is the
 *             single row, which renders one line of empty cells and looks like a styling bug
 *             rather than a pointing error. Omitted => the document IS the rows.
 *   &columns  which keys, in what order, and their labels: `name=Name,email=Email`
 *             Omitted => every key of the first row, in order, @-keys excluded.
 *             A key NOT listed is ignored, so rows may carry ids or notes that are not displayed.
 *   &class    classes ADDED to `estate-table` (the estate table standard), e.g. `estate-fit`
 *             or `estate-sort estate-filter` (`smart-table` still accepted); a call cannot take the standard off.
 *   &caption  optional title, drawn as the estate table's title band. May carry {placeholders} filled from the TOP-LEVEL document,
 *             before &rows is walked — e.g. &caption=`As at {generated} UTC` against a feed whose
 *             envelope is {"generated": "...", "jobs": [...]}. This exists so a table of
 *             freshness can say when IT was fetched: a staleness report with no timestamp is the
 *             thing it is warning about. A placeholder with no matching key renders empty.
 *   &badge    columns whose value is wrapped in a <span> carrying a class, so distinct values are
 *             distinguishable at a glance: `status`. Several columns comma-separated.
 *             Written `status:state`, the COLOUR is looked up from a different field — `status`
 *             is still what the reader sees, `state` is what decides its class. Use that form
 *             whenever the displayed text is free prose: keying colour off the prose means
 *             re-wording a status silently drops its colour, and a value containing a comma
 *             cannot be a &badgeMap key at all. It also leaves `state` in the data as a short
 *             token a search can filter on, which the display text is not.
 *   &badgeMap value=class pairs for those columns, e.g.
 *             `ok=text-bg-success,stale=text-bg-warning,failed=text-bg-danger`.
 *             The value matched is the key field's when &badge names one, else the cell's own.
 *             A value not in the map gets &badgeClass alone — so an enum that GROWS renders as a
 *             neutral badge rather than silently borrowing the colour of whatever it sits near.
 *   &badgeClass  base class on every badge; defaults to `badge`. Bootstrap's own classes, from
 *             the stylesheet the site already loads — this snippet still emits no styling of its
 *             own, only class hooks.
 *   &tip      attach a rich tooltip to one column, built from OTHER fields of the same row, as
 *             `column:key=Label,key=Label` — e.g. `job:max_age_hours=Budget,detail=Detail`.
 *             For the detail that belongs to a row but does not deserve a column of its own: a
 *             seventh column costs every reader width on every row to serve the occasional
 *             question. The fields need not appear in &columns (a key not listed is ignored as
 *             a column), so this is how a value stays reachable without being on screen.
 *             A pair whose value is empty is omitted rather than rendered as a blank line.
 *   &localTime  columns holding an ISO-8601 UTC timestamp, comma-separated. The cell is emitted
 *             as <time datetime="{the original}">, and the DECORATOR rewrites it to the reader's
 *             own clock. The conversion happens in the browser because that is the only place
 *             that knows what "local" means — the server would have to guess a timezone, and a
 *             guessed timezone is worse than UTC because it looks right. The original stays in
 *             the datetime attribute and in the cell's data-sort, so the column still sorts
 *             chronologically after rewriting, and with JavaScript off the honest UTC string is
 *             what remains.
 *   &rowClass put a class on the <tr> according to one column's value, as
 *             `column:value=class,value=class` — e.g. `status:ok=tbl-quiet`. The table stays
 *             COMPLETE: every row is rendered and nothing is filtered away here. Marking a row
 *             is not the same as dropping it, and the difference matters — a reader who cannot
 *             get to the whole table has no way to know what was decided for them. What the
 *             class then does is the decorator's business (tbl-quiet is hidden behind a toggle
 *             by `quiet-first`), and with JavaScript off every row is simply there.
 *   &group    key to group rows by, e.g. &group=`section`. Emits a full-width heading row
 *             (<tr class="estate-row-section"><td colspan=N>) whenever the value
 *             CHANGES — the existing folderContent pattern. The grouping key is dropped from
 *             the columns automatically, since it is shown in the heading, not repeated per row.
 *   &groupClass  extra classes for that heading row's cell; none by default.
 *   &link     make a column a link, as `textKey:hrefKey`, e.g. &link=`name:url` renders the
 *             name cell as <a href="{url}">{name}</a>. Several pairs separated by commas.
 *             Explicit on purpose: nothing is auto-linked by guessing that a value looks like
 *             a URL or an email. The href field is not itself shown as a column unless listed
 *             in &columns. A MODx tag such as [[~992]] works as the href value.
 *   (none)    a document that declares its own `columns` (and `groups` or `rows`, `legend`,
 *             `notes`, `title`, `generated`) is rendered from that declaration alone — see
 *             "SELF-DESCRIBING" in the code. `[[!tableRenderer? &url=`…`]]` is the whole call.
 *   &linkClass  classes applied to those links, e.g. `btn btn-success btn-sm w-100`. Empty
 *             by default, so a link is a plain link unless asked otherwise.
 *
 * CONTRACT
 *   - A missing key renders an EMPTY CELL, never an error: rows legitimately differ (a support
 *     desk has no personal name).
 *   - Rows are NEVER re-ordered. Grouping emits a heading when the value changes, so data stays in
 *     the order the author wrote it; interleaved groups produce repeated headings rather than a
 *     silent re-sort of someone's records.
 *   - Malformed JSON renders NOTHING plus an HTML comment naming the fault. A bad table must never
 *     take the page down with it — this is what contains the one real risk of rendering at runtime:
 *     it fails per table, not per site. A URL that times out, refuses, or answers with something
 *     that is not JSON is the same class of event and is handled the same way: the table is
 *     missing, the page is fine, and the reason is in the source for whoever looks.
 *   - &url makes ONE outbound request, with a timeout, and never follows a redirect to a
 *     different host. What it may fetch is controlled by the fact that page content reaches
 *     production only through git and the content deploy — a URL in a page is authored,
 *     reviewed and diffable. That is the control; there is no separate allow-list to drift.
 *   - Markup only. Classes are emitted; the CSS is the owner's. No inline styles.
 *   - Values are HTML-escaped. Auto-linking emails and URLs is deliberately NOT done; use &link.
 *   - A newline inside a value becomes <br>, so multi-line values (a postal address) survive
 *     without the author embedding markup in their data.
 *
 * Derives purely from the resource + properties, so it may be called cached or uncached.

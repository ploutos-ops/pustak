"""doors.py — MODx publishes every door it offers and who may call each. Constitution rule 21.

WHY THIS FILE IS NOT AN IMPORT OF THE SHARED LIBRARY. `services/_rule21/doors_lib.py` walks a
Python handler's AST. MODx is PHP, and its handlers are ELEMENTS — snippet and plugin bodies that
live in `modx_site_snippets.snippet` and `modx_site_plugins.plugincode`, database columns, whose
repository copies are the files beside this one. There is nothing for that library to import. The
OUTPUT is kept byte-compatible with it — same field names, same types — because four services
already publish that shape and a fifth answering differently is the defect whois spent a rewrite
removing.

THE TWO HALVES OF A MODX DOOR LIVE IN TWO PLACES, and pretending otherwise is how this file would
lie:

    WHO MAY CALL IT   is in the element's own source, in this repository. Mechanical, read below.
    WHERE IT ANSWERS  is a RESOURCE in the MODx database — the estate. "The repo carries no estate"
                      (the owner, 2026-08-01), so a path written into this file would be a second copy
                      of somebody else's fact and would rot the first time a page moved.

So the listing is keyed by ELEMENT and its `path` is filled from a MODx database when one is
reachable (`--db`, or MODX_DOORS_DSN), and is `estate-bound` when one is not. A run with no
database is honest and incomplete; it never invents a path. Which of the two you got is on the row.

THE DOOR IS READ OUT OF THE ELEMENT'S OWN CODE — a small vocabulary of call names, not a map of
paths, so an element that stops checking its caller cannot keep a door it no longer has:

    Application::acceptedClient   identity:estate-CA client certificate (nginx verifies the chain)
    GoogleToken::verify           the READER'S OWN Google id_token, verified here
    isAuthenticated               a signed-in MODx session in this context
    none of these                 `open:` — a finding when it should not be, true when it should

AND THE CALL COUNTS ONLY WHEN THE ELEMENT REFUSES ON IT. The first version of this file took any
of the three as a door, and four of fourteen elements disproved that within a minute of pointing it
at the real tree:

  · GoogleSSOStart calls isAuthenticated to REDIRECT a visitor who is already signed in — the
    opposite of refusing an anonymous one.
  · GoogleSSOLogout calls it to say "you are still signed into the manager" in the page it renders.
  · tableRenderer calls it inside its &auth branch to name the READER it fetches as; with nobody
    signed in it renders a message and the page is still served.
  · the bookkeeping-names plugin calls it and, per the owner's own rule for that plugin — "if not logged in, display
    blank" — returns silently. A blank cell is not a refusal.

So a guard is a caller-establishing call PLUS a refusal in the same element ($send(401), a 401/403
status, sendUnauthorizedPage). What that correction reveals is the useful fact and it is not what I
expected: MODX HAS EXACTLY ONE DOOR OF ITS OWN, /actuator/info. Everything else is a page served
under MODx's resource access control — contexts and resource groups — and the elements are
fragments rendered inside a page whose readability was already decided before they ran.

WHAT A HUMAN SUPPLIES is the smallest thing: a REASON for each element that establishes no caller
of its own. Most of them are correct: a page fragment inherits MODx's resource access control, and
the sign-in flow cannot require a session because it is what creates one. An open door is lawful;
an UNEXPLAINED one is what an audit flags.

    doors.py                     print the listing
    doors.py --json              the same, as data
    doors.py --check             exit 1 on an open door with no reason, or a reason with no element
    doors.py --db mysql://...    resolve where each element is served from a MODx database
